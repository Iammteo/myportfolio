         I started my tech journey out of curiosity of discerning how things work and how to replicate them especially relating to software projects and was also fascinated at the results,
          along the way I also faced challenges and I knew I needed help and direction to achieve my goal this lead me to enroll at Aptech for a software engineering course.
           As I kept on growing in knowledge of the tech world I came to realize that it was really vast and this helped me to keep an open mind knowing that there is always more to learn.

         Along the way I also picked up some other professional courses like project management. Currently I'm known for my precision in coding and finesse in orchestrating projects from start to finish. I thrive in collaborative environments, fostering teamwork for optimal results. Effective communication and attention to detail are my cornerstones for successful project management. Beyond personal achievements, I aspire to drive positive change through technology. Outside of work, I enjoy swimming, chess, and movies, adding balance to my life.
